# GUI for Texconv
[Texconv](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv) is a texture converter made by Microsoft.<br>
But it doesn't support GUI.<br>
So I made my own GUI for Texconv. <br>
Download texconv.exe form [here](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases) and put in the same directory as SimpleCommandRunner.exe and gui_definition.json.
