```json
"components": [
    {
        "type": "static_text",
        "label": "This is a sample GUI. Edit 'gui_definition.json' for your scripts."
    },
    {
        "type": "text",
        "label": "Some text"
    }
]
```

-   `static_text` is a string component. You don't need to put `%*%` in command for this component.
-   `text` is a text box.
